# AIRBNB-DATASET
Framework to train, tune and evaluate machine learning models on several tasks that are tackled by the Airbnb team. 


The main task of the project is to train, tune and evaluate machine learning models on the Airbnb dataset.

Framework to train, tune and evaluate machine learning models on several tasks that are tackled by the Airbnb team. 
The cleaned data is now used to train regression and classification models to predict price and category respectively.
After prediction, we evaluate the loss and try to imporove our model by optimising our hyperparameters.

PyTorch 
----------------------------------------------------------

PyTorch is an open source ml library based on the Torch library. PyTorch provides a variety of tools and utilities for building and training neural networks, including automatic differentiation, tensor computation with GPU acceleration, and a high-level API for building neural network models.
PyTorch is used to build neural networks to predict the price of houses and the number of bedrooms. 
The best model, hyperparameters and metrics are stored for future reference.
